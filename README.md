# 27C513_EMU
This project creates an emulator PCB to allow 27C512 to be used in place of the hard-to-find 27C513.

PCB layout is in Circuit Studio (of the Altium family).  Zip files for the project directory and Gerber outputs, PDFs for schem.

This project was inspired by the need to support EPROMs for the ACC RC-850 repeater controllers but applies to any design that needs a 27C513 EPROM.

It should be possible to program a 27C512 with the same object data destined for the 27C513 (yet to be confirmed).

!! This adapter is not intended to connect to a device programmer !!  EPROMS must be programmed separately, then installed into the emulator module.
